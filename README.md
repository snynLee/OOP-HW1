Development of Simplified Games

1. Position the player at 10.

2. Place Enemy at 50.

3. Three seconds after the game starts, a bullet comes out of the player position and moves towards Enemy.

4. After the bullet reaches Enemy, the bullet disappears.

When creating a game that satisfies the above function, implement it using only one printf function per frame.
